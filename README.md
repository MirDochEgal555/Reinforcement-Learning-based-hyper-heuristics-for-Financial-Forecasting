# Reinforcement Learning-based Hyper-Heuristics for Financial Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on the development and application of reinforcement learning techniques to design hyper-heuristics specifically for financial forecasting problems. Financial forecasting is a challenging task due to the complexity and volatility of financial markets. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of financial predictions.

## Objectives
- To explore various reinforcement learning algorithms and frameworks.
- To develop hyper-heuristic approaches that can adapt to different financial forecasting tasks.
- To evaluate the performance of the developed models against traditional forecasting methods.

## Techniques Used
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilization of Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Policy Gradient methods to train models.
- **Hyper-Heuristics:** Strategies that automate the selection and configuration of heuristics for solving optimization problems.
- **Financial Time Series Analysis:** Techniques and tools for analyzing time series data relevant to financial markets.
